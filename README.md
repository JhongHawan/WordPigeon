# Word Pigeon 

## Getting Started

Welcome to Word Pigeon, a hackathon project for Terminal Hackathon 2020 #TechTakesOnCOVID. In a fight to help individuals affected by COVID-19 Word Pigeon joins to help problems around the education sector. Our Android app uses machine learning image classification to make learning language vocabulary more enjoyable. Users are able to capture images of objects and our app will relay the top 3 most likely classifications and their language translations. 

* *Our app currently only supports translations from English to these languages  
(Based off most learned languages in the United States):* 
1. Spanish
2. French
3. German
4. Italian
5. Japanese
